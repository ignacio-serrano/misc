In this directory you should put everything needed to build your image. 
Everthing, but nothing more. Before building, the whole content of directory 
containing the Dockerfile is sent to the Docker daemon, so the less you have
in it, the less time consumed sending it.
Aside from Dockerfile, any directories and files used in ADD operations must be
in this directory. It's also advisable to keep here the script that compresses
not binded volumes for backup. It can be included in the image at build time or
copied by «docker cp».
