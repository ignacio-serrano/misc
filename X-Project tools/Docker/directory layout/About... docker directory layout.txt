I've found this layout to be usefull. In this directory you will find a set of 
scripts wich are shortcuts to my top 5 docker commands (all targeted to the 
same image and container name). Also an empty file named after the container 
to enable autocomplete when manually typing other commands.

Here, there are also 3 subdirectories:
- volumes: directory where host binded volumes of the container live.
- backups: directory where backup script should store backups of not binded 
volumes.
- image: it contains just the necessary to build the image (Dockerfile and ADD
stuff).

More info in the "About..." of every directory.
